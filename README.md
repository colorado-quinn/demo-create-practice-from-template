Hello!

This repository represents some continued thoughts on a problem prompt.

Most notably, the logic to "fill up" a practice session to the desired time: drills are looped thorugh and 5 minute increments are added to each until the desired practice duration is met.  Drills are looped through in reverse order, assuming that the later drills are more important in case time is not evenly distributed across all drills.
